# First Person 3D World

This is a prototype of a first-person 3D world. The purpose of this project is to learn how to create a 3D world using OpenGL library, and also to learn how to create and use shader programs & vertex arrays for 3D models.

This project is part of a book that I'm currently reading (see below for name of the book).

## Technologies Used

Languages and libraries used for this project include, Python, shader language, SDL2 (to initialize OpenGL and load texture), and OpenGL for 3D graphics. For the organization of classes, a technique that mixes *hierarchy game object model* and *composition game object model* is applied. 

## Demonstration

Note: All source code for this 3D world prototype can be found inside `.py` files.

*The book I'm currently reading for this project is called, **Game Programming in C++**.*
